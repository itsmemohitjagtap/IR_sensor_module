# IR Sensor Module PCB Design

📌 **Project Overview**

This project is a **PCB design practice project** for an **IR Sensor Module**, created to strengthen hands-on skills in schematic design and PCB layout using **Altium Designer**. The module is conceptually designed for **object detection and proximity sensing** applications commonly used in embedded systems and robotics.

This project focuses on the **design workflow only** and does not include fabrication or physical testing. It is part of my learning journey in professional PCB design using **Altium Designer 25.2.1**.

🔩 **Components Used**

- IR Receiver (TSOP series)  
- Op-Amp (LM358)  
- Trimmer Potentiometer  
- IR LED and Indicator LED  
- Resistors and Capacitors  
- 4-pin header (VCC, GND, AOUT, DOUT)

🖥️ **Software Used**

- **Altium Designer 25.2.1**

🔧 **How It Works**

- The IR LED emits infrared light which reflects off nearby objects.  
- The IR receiver detects the reflected signal.  
- Signal conditioning and comparison are performed using an op-amp.  
- The digital output triggers when the signal crosses a set threshold, while the analog output provides raw signal variation.  
- Sensitivity can be adjusted using the onboard trimmer potentiometer.
